## Credits

This project was heavily influenced by the teachings and guidance of my instructor at Fullstack Academy. In addition, I owe a profound debt of gratitude to the several mentors at MentorII, who, in collaboration with the instructor, played an instrumental role in our coding bootcamp training sessions. Their collective expertise, patience, and insights were invaluable in shaping both this project and my evolution as a developer. Beyond that, resources from online platforms like the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN), W3Schools, Stack Overflow, and the challenges on `exercism.org` significantly boosted my understanding and proficiency. Lastly, a heartfelt thanks to my peers for their continual feedback and camaraderie throughout this learning journey.
